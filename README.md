Each filter performs partial search (`contains`) and can be combined with others.

---

## ⚡ Warning Fix (CS8602)

If you encounter the compiler warning:

```
CS8602: Possible dereference of a null reference
```

✅ Solution in `ImportXmlService.cs`:
```csharp
if (env.Items == null)
    return BadRequest("No items found in XML");

foreach (var item in env.Items!)
{
    // process each item
}
```

Or safely:
```csharp
foreach (var item in env.Items ?? [])
{
    ...
}
```

---

## 🧰 Database (Optional)

If you want to create and seed the table manually, use `Database/seed.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE BusinessCards (
    Id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    Gender INT,
    DateOfBirth DATETIME,
    Email NVARCHAR(100),
    Phone NVARCHAR(20),
    Address NVARCHAR(200),
    PhotoBase64 NVARCHAR(MAX),
    PhotoSizeBytes INT
);

INSERT INTO BusinessCards (Id, Name, Gender, DateOfBirth, Email, Phone, Address, PhotoBase64, PhotoSizeBytes)
VALUES 
(NEWID(), 'John Doe', 1, '1990-05-10', 'john@mail.com', '0771234567', 'Amman, Jordan', '', 0),
(NEWID(), 'Jane Smith', 2, '1992-08-15', 'jane@mail.com', '0789876543', 'Zarqa, Jordan', '', 0);
```
